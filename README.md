A Qt program which efficiently handles a stream of disks (floppies, CDs or
whatever), capturing optical images using a scanner and simultaneously
grabbing the data contents to disk image files (similar to dd).

Also can browse, search and mount images thus captured.

Depends on Qt 4 so far (could probably be updated). It's the first time
that I used SANE API for scanners in a C++ program.
